	<p id="star-par">Sensors indicate a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex,
		the brain stem,  the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that
		would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular sensors
		polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons
		with phase discriminators. Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares
		are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence
		of an advanced communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield
		effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp
		drive could cross in the given time. Resistance is futile.</p>
